Boilerplate to make a music album using Boostrap and jQuery

Let's create a website to showcase Music Albums and play songs.

A new-age music studio wants to create a website to showcase their singers. They offer you a two-pages boilerplate and ask you to use it as a reference to implement the site using Boostrap and jQuery, by following the next steps:

1) Clone the repo to your local computer and include Boostrap and jQuery to both HTML pages.

2) Replace the images by the HTML/CSS code that produces the same or similar results. Hardcode all the texts and images for now.

3) Update the page "home.html" to list the albums stored in the file "albums.js". There are three albums in the file, but if they add another one it should show withouth modifiying the HTML file. Once you click an album, it should take you to "album.html?id=XXX", where XXX is the album id.

4) Update the page "album.html", so when it receives a request of the type "album.html?id=XXX", displays the album information from "albums.js". The page play a song if the "play" button is clicked.
